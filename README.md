# 🧠 AI Code Reviewer

An intelligent web application that reviews and provides feedback on code snippets using AI (like GeminiAI's GPT). Built with the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** stack, this app aims to help developers improve their code quality, catch bugs early, and learn better practices.

📦 **Tech Stack**

* **MongoDB** – Stores code snippets and feedback
* **Express.js** – Backend framework
* **React.js** – Frontend user interface
* **Node.js** – Backend runtime
* **GeminiAI API** – AI model for code analysis

---

## 🦄 Features

Here’s what you can do with **AI Code Reviewer**:

🔹 **Submit Snippets**
Paste code in JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, or other languages.

🔹 **AI-Powered Feedback**
Get suggestions for:

* Code optimization
* Bug fixes
* Best practices
* Readability improvements

🔹 **Bug Detection**
Identify potential logic or syntax issues in real-time.

🔹 **Explanation & Learning**
Get clear explanations of what your code does and how it can be improved.

🔹 **Save Snippets**
Store previous submissions and reviews for future reference.

🔹 **User-Friendly Interface**
Clean, intuitive layout built with React.js and responsive form elements.

## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

I started by creating a minimal Express.js backend that connects to MongoDB and exposes API routes to handle code submissions. On the frontend, I designed a React-based interface with a code editor and response panel.

After integrating GeminiAI's API, I built logic to send user code to the model and render intelligent feedback in real-time. I worked on features like saving snippets to the database, retrieving past reviews, and displaying them in a dashboard.

I prioritized making the app smart and functional rather than focusing on responsiveness. This helped me concentrate on deeper logic, backend integrations, and AI handling.

To ensure reliability, I tested the backend API with tools like Postman and built component-level tests using React Testing Library.

Throughout the development, I maintained logs of every challenge I faced, how I fixed it, and what I learned—turning this project into both a product and a personal learning archive.

## 📚 What I Learned

🧠 **Integrating AI into Web Apps**
Understanding how to send prompts, parse responses, and provide meaningful feedback.

🔌 **Full-Stack Flow**
Connecting frontend, backend, and database in a seamless loop.

📜 **Prompt Engineering**
Crafting the right prompt for GeminiAI to return concise and helpful results.

💾 **MongoDB Usage**
Storing structured and unstructured data (code, feedback, timestamps).

🎣 **React Hooks & State Handling**
Using `useEffect`, `useReducer`, and context to manage app state efficiently.

📈 **Backend Validation & Security**
Sanitizing inputs and ensuring API reliability before sending to the AI model.

🧪 **Testing**
Learned basics of API testing, React component testing, and handling asynchronous responses.

## 💭 How Can It Be Improved?

* Add **syntax highlighting** using a library like Monaco Editor
* Add **language selection dropdown** for more accurate analysis
* Add **AI confidence meter** (based on token matching or Gemini API metadata)
* Add **login/auth system** for saving user sessions
* Add **team/collab mode** with shared snippet reviews
* Add **dark/light theme toggle**
* Add **history search and filters**
* Add **auto-save drafts**

## 🚦 Running the Project

To run the project in your local environment:

1. Clone the repository
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-code-reviewer.git`

2. Navigate into the project folder
   `cd ai-code-reviewer`

3. Install dependencies

   * For backend:

     ```bash
     cd server  
     npm install
     ```

   * For frontend:

     ```bash
     cd client  
     npm install
     ```

4. Set up `.env` file in the `server` folder with your GeminiAI API key and MongoDB URI.

5. Run the servers

   * Backend: `npm run dev`
   * Frontend: `npm run dev`

6. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
